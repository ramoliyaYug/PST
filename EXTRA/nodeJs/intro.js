/*
- what is nodeJs:
 - nodeJs is the open source, cross platform javascript runtime environment.

- why learn nodeJs:
 - build end to end javascript applications
 - all major companies migrate from other backend technologies to nodeJs.
 - full stack development is one of the sought skill sets
 - huge community support

- chrome v8 engine and javascript engine:

- chrome v8 engine is the core of the nodeJs.
- by embedding v8 engine into the c++ program so when user writes the javascript code than that c++ code will be executed.

- javascript runtime environment:
 - which provides all the neccesary components in order to use and run a js program

-what can you build with nodeJs:
 - traditional website
 - backend services like APIs
 - real time applications
 - streaming services
 - CLI tools
 - multiplayer games

- nodeJs is not a language or not a framework.

- executing javascript with nodeJs:
 1. Node REPL
 - Read
 - Evaluate
 - Print
 - Loop

 2. executing javascript file in command line

- browser vs nodeJs
 - in browser, most of the time what you are doing is interacting with DOM or other web platform APIs like cookies. you don't have the document, window and all the other objects that provide by the browser.

 - in the browser, we don't have all the nice APIs that nodeJs provides through its modules. for example the filesystem access functionality.

 - with nodeJs you control the environment.

 - with browser, you are at the mercy of what the user choose

Modules:
- a modules is an encapsulated and reusable chunk of code that has its own context in nodeJs, each file is treated as a separate module

-types of modules:
 - local modules: modules that we create in our application
 - built-in-modules: modules that nodeJs ships with out of the box
 - third-party-modules: modules written by other developers that we can use in our application

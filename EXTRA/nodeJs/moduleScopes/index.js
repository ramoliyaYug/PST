require('./batman.js');
require('./superman.js');

//so here we have console loged same variable name from two different files so it is possible in the nodeJs cuzzz the nodeJs has the specified scopes for the each module
//so the bith batman and superman is printing in the console

//just like thsi nodeJs has the same module scopes for each module
//this feature of the nodeJs will save us from the worring about the name about function and variables
//so the proper encapsulation is done and reusability is unaffected.
//this provides tha private scoping of the variables and functions
//it allowa to reapet the functiona dn variables without any conflicts

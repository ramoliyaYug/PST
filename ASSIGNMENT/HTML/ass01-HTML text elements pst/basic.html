    <h1>Subscript and Superscript Examples</h1>
    <p>The chemical formula for glucose is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>.</p>
    <p>The Pythagorean theorem states that a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>, where a and b are the legs of a right triangle and c is the hypotenuse.</p>
    <p>The formation of water can be represented by the equation 2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
    <p>The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s.</p>
    <p>The molecular weight of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is 18 g/mol.</p>
    <p>The formula for sodium chloride is NaCl, where Na is sodium and Cl is chlorine.</p>
    <p>In scientific terms, the speed of light is approximately 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s.</p>
    <p>The gravitational force can be described by the equation F = G(m<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub>)/r<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p>John Dalton proposed that elements consist of atoms of varying weights. For instance, the atomic mass of Carbon is C<sub>12</sub>, which refers to the most abundant isotope.</p>
    <p>In everyday life, we often see mathematical expressions such as E=mc<sup>2</sup> which represents Einstein's theory of relativity.</p>
    <p>Another common example is the formula for sulfuric acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, used in batteries.</p>

<body>
    <p>
        Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is <strong>essential for survival</strong> and plays a crucial role in maintaining <b>hydration</b> and <b>health</b>. It is important to <em>drink water regularly</em> to support vital bodily functions and prevent dehydration. In life, it’s also important to <i>go with the flow</i>, embracing change just as water adapts to its surroundings.<strong><em>drinking enough water daily</em></strong> becomes vital for maintaining overall well-being.

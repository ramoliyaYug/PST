/*
You are given a number x and array arr[]. Your task is to rearrange the elements of the array according to the absolute difference with x, i.e., an element having minimum difference comes first, and so on.
Note: If two or more elements are at equal distances arrange them in the same sequence as in the given array.

Examples:

Input: x = 7, arr[] = [10, 5, 3, 9, 2]
Output: [5, 9, 10, 3, 2]
Explanation: Sorting the numbers according to the absolute difference with 7, we have array elements as 5, 9, 10, 3, 2.
Input: x = 6, arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Explanation: Sorting the numbers according to the absolute difference with 6, we have array elements as 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Constraints:
1 ≤ x ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105

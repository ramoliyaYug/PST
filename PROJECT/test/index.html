Problem Statement: Responsive Student Portfolio with Table
Enhancements
You have been tasked with creating a Student Portfolio website that showcases projects and
allows visitors to contact the student. The portfolio should be responsive and visually appealing,
implementing advanced HTML and CSS techniques. The design must be user-friendly and
adapt to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
Requirements:
1. Header and Navigation:
○ The header should include the student’s name and navigation links to "About
Me", "Projects", and "Contact" sections.
○ The navigation should be responsive and switch to a vertical layout on smaller
screens.
2. Projects Section:
○ Use a table layout for the projects section, ensuring the design adapts to various
screen sizes:
○ The projects should be listed in a table with columns for "Project Name",
"Description", and "Technologies Used".
○ The table should support hover functionality:
■ When hovering over a table row, the row should "glow" (i.e., change the
background color, and scale slightly).
3. Contact Form:
○ The portfolio must include a contact form with the following fields:
■ Name (text input)
■ Email (email input)
■ Message (textarea)
■ Button (button with hover)
○ All fields should be required, and the form should be accessible and easy to use
on all devices.
4. Responsive Design:
○ Implement media queries to ensure the portfolio adapts to different screen sizes:
■ On small screens (below 768px), the layout should adjust to a single
column.
■ On larger screens (above 1024px), the grid should have a 3-column
layout for the projects section.
5. Styling and Animations:
○ Use CSS pseudo-classes to enhance interactivity (e.g., hover, active).
○ Add smooth transitions to the hover effects for a polished user experience.
6. Additional Considerations:
○ Ensure the layout uses CSS Grid and Flexbox where appropriate to structure
the content.
○ Add any necessary CSS properties for basic styling like fonts, colors, margins,
paddings, and border styles.
Deliverables:
● A fully functional HTML file that implements the portfolio structure.
● A CSS file that contains the necessary styles, including grid layout, media queries,
pseudo-classes for the table hover effect, and responsive design features.
Bonus:
● Add CSS animations to enhance the user experience further.
